	Description: The assignment is meant to teach us how to use the cout
	function and be able to print things when compiled and executed
	In this instance we had to print out the assignment, our name, and initials 
	using the cout output stream. 
	
	Input: the program has been given cout commands to print out specific
	characters line by line that will create my initials using the
	first letter of my first and last name
	along with a header that contains my name and
	the course assignment number
	
	Output: When the cpp program is executed then it will print out a header
	and under that my initials using the first letter of my first and last
	name in that order

	// and my name
